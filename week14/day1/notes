To start a REACT project:

1. $ npx create-react-app name_of_project

2. move projects directory: cd name_of_project

  2.2 $ npm start

    2.3 A browser tab will appear on localhost:3000 (your react app)

3. You need to put any JS and CSS files inside the src folder. 
 otherwise webpack wonâ€™t see them!

  3.2 You need to put any HTML files inside the public folder.


public/: This folder holds development files, such as public/index.html. The index file is displayed on localhost:3000 when the app is in development or on a domain that is hosted elsewhere. The default setup handles relating this index.html with all the JavaScript from src/.
