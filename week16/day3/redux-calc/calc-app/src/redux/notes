when we want to work with redux we:

1. $npm i redux react-redux
2. make redux folder.
    2.1 create reducer.js
    2.2 create actions.js

3. move the state from the app to the reducer

4. build actions.

5. create the store in index.js.
import createStore, Provider, reducer.

6. connect your components.
